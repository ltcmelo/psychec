# Psyche-C

Psyche is a compiler frontend for the C programming language. Psyche-C is specifically designed for the implementation of static analysis tools. Below are the distinct features that make Psyche-C a rather unique C frontend:

- Clean separation between the syntactic and semantic phases.
- Both algorithmic and heuristic syntax disambiguation strategeies.
- Indepedence of `#include` headers and type inference for the missing `struct`, `union`, `enum', and `typedef`.
- API inspired by that of the [Roslyn .NET compiler](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn).
- Resemblance between the AST resulting from its parser and that of the [LLVM's Clang frontend](https://clang.llvm.org/).

Check out [this online interface](http://cuda.dcc.ufmg.br/psyche-c/).

Applications:

- Enabling, on incomplete source-code, static analysis techniques that depend on fully-typed programs.
- Compiling a code snippet (e.g., retrieved from a bug tracker) for object-code inspection.
- Generating test-input data for individual functions.
- Quick prototyping of an algorithm, without the need of explicit types.

**Note**: The master branch is going through a major overhaul; at this point, it's expected that syntax analysis (parsing and AST construction) is functional, though. The original version of Psyche-C is available in [this branch](https://github.com/ltcmelo/psychec/tree/original).

## The Cnippet Driver Adaptor

While Psyche-C is primarily used as a library for the implementation of static analysis tools, it still is a compiler frontend, and may also be used as such — this is done through the *cnippet* driver adaptor.

```c
// node.c
void f()
{
    T v = 0;
    v->value = 42;
    v->next = v;
}
```

If you compile this snippet with GCC or Clang, you'd see a diagnostic _"the declaration for"_ `T` _"is not available"_. But with the *cnippet* driver adaptor (command line `./cnip.sh -f gcc -c node.c`), a definition for `T` is inferred and the compilation succeeds.

## Building and Testing

Requirements: cmake, a C++17 compiler, and the Haskell Stack.

    cmake CMakeLists.txt  
    make -j 4
    
    ./test-suite
